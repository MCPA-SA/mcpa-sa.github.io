After our CTF last year, we began developing our own scoring platform for CTF.
That platform is nearly ready for prime-time and is published on our github
<a href='https://github.com/mcpa-stlouis/hack-the-arch'>here</a>!  We will be
using it in our upcoming CTF which we'll be announcing soon!  The project site
is here: <a href='https://hta.mcpa-stl.org'>https://hta.mcpa-stl.org</a>, with
a live demo here: <a
